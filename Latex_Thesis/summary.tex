\chapter{Summary and Conclusions}

This thesis summarizes IoT hardware and its limitations, explores the different OS solutions, shows proof of concept methodologies using QEMU, and proposes a standardizes OS for IoT edge devices, the Linux kernel, with a plethora of tools that facilitate cross compilation and boot loading. 
possible tools used to succesfully standardize MCU's on an OS  level. It also shows the challenges that are faced, when trying to homogenize such a heterogeneous and interconnected field such as IoT. 

This thesis provides a modular refined toolchain container for diverse uses for embedded Linux, with defined structure, that can be used to cross-compile Linux kernel source code and evaluate its correctness. 

QEMU is not the most reliable.
