First and foremost, I would like to thank my research supervisor, Dr. Eryk Schiller, without whom this thesis would not have been possible. I would like to thank, Dr. Eryk Schiller for his guidance, patience, for every meeting we held, and his high-level insights on the topic at hand. Furthermore, I want to extend my gratitude to Prof. Dr. Brukhard Stiller for providing me with the opportunity to write my bachelors thesis at the Communication Systems Group (CSG) in the University of Zurich.

Thanks also goes to STM Technical Marketing Manager Marco Sanfilippo and STM as a company, for providing us with feedback, consultation, and with two STM32L4 development boards, on which we performed some tests.
